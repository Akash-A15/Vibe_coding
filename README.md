## Data Storage

The application uses simple JSON files for data storage:

- **team-members.json**: Stores team member information
- **work-logs.json**: Stores work hour entries
- **tasks.json**: Stores task information

Data files are automatically created in the `data/` directory when the server starts.

### Adding New Activity Categories
Edit the worklog category options in `public/index.html`:
```html
<select id="worklog-category">
    <option value="testing">Testing</option>
    <option value="automation">Automation</option>
    <!-- Add your custom categories here -->
</select>
```

### Modifying Team Roles
Update the role options in `public/index.html`:
```html
<select id="member-role" required>
    <option value="Senior QA Engineer">Senior QA Engineer</option>
    <!-- Add your custom roles here -->
</select>
```

### Styling Changes
Modify `public/styles.css` to customize colors, layout, and styling to match your organization's branding.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `server.js` or set environment variable:
   ```bash
   PORT=3001 npm start
   ```

2. **Data Not Persisting**
   - Ensure write permissions in the project directory
   - Check that the `data/` folder is created successfully

3. **Modules Not Found**
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Ensure you're in the correct project directory
